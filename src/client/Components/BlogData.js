      A little about me. My name is Spencer LeBard, and it’s been a winding journey to get here. I’ve been living in the Pacific Northwest almost my entire life. I grew up in Seattle and moved to Boise in middle school when my family couldn’t take another year of the soul crushing ‘big dark’ Seattle winter. I’ll never forget the day when my dad and I were in the car on the way home from soccer practice.  It was dark and rainy as I’ve ever seen.  We sat in silence as the traffic light made multiple cycles – green, yellow, red, green, yellow, red, over and over without moving in traffic.  I asked him “why do we live here?” and he sat in silence, for maybe a minute or two deeply pondering that question. Soon enough we were house hunting in the high desert of Boise, ID.  Now, some people out there will get upset if you count Boise, ID as a member of the PNW – I’m not here to have that argument (except it obviously is).
  
  There were a few exceptions to me living in the PNW. I lived in SL,UT for undergrad and China for a while when I didn’t know what I wanted to do out of school. I was a math and science ACT prep teacher in a small village of 10 million in Zhenzhou, China.  When I came back I worked for my dad for a little while before setting at a tech startup.  That’s where I found my love for technology.  I had always wanted to program (“program” was what it was called when I was young – as opposed to “code” or “develop” nowadays), I bought books, took classes at every level of my education but it never seemed to stick.  I think it didn’t stick was because I hated school and did the absolute bare minimum to graduate as fast as possible. Years later, I managed to convince the recruiters and hiring managers at a respectable software consultancy I was worth taking a chance on, so I worked my butt off and have managed to pull off the “up” option in the consulting “up or out” saying.
  
  The purpose of this blog is to take my experiences and perspective on technology, travel, bbq, life, love, and anything else that pops into my head and put it in writing here.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
