      A little about me.
My name is Spencer LeBard, and it's been a winding journey getting here. I've lived in the Pacific Northwest almost my entire life, growing up in Seattle before moving to Boise during middle school, when my family decided they couldn't endure another soul-crushing "big dark" Seattle winter. I'll never forget a particular evening ride home from soccer practice with my dad. It was as dark and rainy as I'd ever seen, and we sat silently, watching the traffic light cycle endlessly—green, yellow, red, repeat—without any cars moving. I asked him, "Why do we live here?" He paused thoughtfully, and considered the question.  Within weeks, we were house hunting in the sunny high desert of Boise, Idaho. Some might debate whether Boise belongs in the PNW—I'm not here to argue that (though it obviously does).
I've ventured out of the Pacific Northwest a couple of times. First, to Salt Lake City, Utah, for my undergrad years, and later, to China when I wasn't sure what to do after graduation. I taught ACT math and science prep in Zhengzhou—a modest village of 10 million people. Returning stateside, I briefly worked with my dad before joining a tech startup, where I truly discovered my passion for technology.
I'd always aspired to program—though back then, we called it "programming," not "coding" or "developing." Despite buying countless books and enrolling in programming classes throughout my education, it never really stuck, probably because I hated school and did just enough to graduate quickly. Eventually, though, I managed to convince recruiters and hiring managers at a respected software consultancy to take a chance on me. I worked by butt off, and ultimately achieving the "up" side of consulting's notorious "up or out" equation.
This blog aims to share my experiences and perspectives on technology, travel, barbecue, life, love, and whatever else pops into my head. I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoy writing it.

      title: "2: Businesses Are Full of Selfish People",

        Something I’ve been thinking about recently: Most businesses and corporations are filled primarily with 
        people who are selfish. There are exceptions, of course—I’m currently working with a woman who's been at her 
        company for about 25 years and genuinely cares deeply about what's best for the organization and the customer's experience. But she represents an exception rather than the rule. 
        Let’s set that aside for now and face the reality that, in general, most of your coworkers—IT guy, salespeople, or even those colleagues you're emailing for status updates right 
        now—are fundamentally motivated by self-interest. They care about their promotions, raises, recognition, and—let's be frank—often doing 
        just enough to avoid negative consequences. Yet here's the paradox I've been thinking on: Ironically, what 
        actually benefits each individual the most is working genuinely hard and providing true value. Promotions, raises, and positive recognition are generally 
        achieved by effort, initiative, and smart office politics. This brings to mind the paradox that Oppenheimer described about light 
        existing simultaneously as particles and waves (“Its paradoxical, but it works”). Similarly, to succeed within a corporation, you must
         embrace a dual reality: selfishly looking out for your own interests is most effective when it aligns closely with the value you provide to the company.
